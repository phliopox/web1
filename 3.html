  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="html5 specification"> JavaScript</a>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>

  <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries. Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.</P>

  <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces  for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model.</P>

  <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output , such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for.</P>

  <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.</P>

  <p>Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
